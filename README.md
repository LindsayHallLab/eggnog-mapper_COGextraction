Extraction of COG functional classes and save the data in csv format

This is a simple bash script designed for extracting COG classes and save it in csv format for downstream visualisation.

This works in specific working directory and execute using Linux command line:

$ ./extract_COG.sh

This will generate the final file COG_final.csv with column 1 the COG classes and column 2 is the hit counts.
