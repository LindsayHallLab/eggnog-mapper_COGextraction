# eggnog-mapper_COGextraction
Extraction of COG functional classes and save the data in csv format

This works on the annotated file ends with ".emapper.annotations" generated by eggnog-mapper (https://github.com/jhcepas/eggnog-mapper).

This is a simple bash script written for the convenience of extracting COG classes and save it in csv format for downstream visualisation.

This works in specific working directory and execute using Linux command line:

$ ./extract_COG.sh

This will generate the final file COG_final.csv with column 1 the COG classes and column 2 is the hit counts.
