# eggnog-mapper_COGextraction
## Introduction
* Extraction of COG functional classes and save the data in csv format for downstream analysis
* This works on the annotated file ends with ".emapper.annotations" generated by eggnog-mapper (https://github.com/jhcepas/eggnog-mapper).
* This is a simple shell script written for the convenience of extracting COG classes and save it in csv format for downstream analysis and visualisation.

## Usage
```
$ ./extract_COG.sh FILENAME
```
* This will generate the final extracted file FILENAME-COG-final.csv with column 1 the COG classes and column 2 is the hit counts (separated by commas).
